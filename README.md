* Demonsrate understand of sql queries and how to retrieve information out of a database.

## Details

### Deliverables

* A repo containing at least:
  * a database (mdf file) of your data.
  * a schema.sql file that contains the queries to create the tables
  * a queries.sql file that contains the sql queries to generate the answers required.


## Normal Mode

1. Import the librarybooks.xlsx (librarybooks.xlsx) file into your database.
2. Analyze the data and draw out a diagram of the table structures that you will need.
